# Commercial Operator Licensing System

The Commercial Operator Licensing System (COLS) is used by customers applying for a licence to deliver tourist and educational services for a profit while on land managed by the Department and to pay for the access fees to access these lands. The system is used by Department staff to process the licence applications and to manage issued licences.

It is a database-backed Django application, using REST API with Vue.js as the client side app and integrates into the ledger system.
